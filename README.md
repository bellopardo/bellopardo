### Academics 
I am currently pursuing a doctorate in Political Science at American University in Washington, D.C. I study both American and Comparative Politics, but am more specifically interested in public opinion, political communication, and survey methodology. My dissertation studies the effect of online communication on political attitudes, focusing on both textual and visual misinformation. I carry out most of this research within the American context, but I am also intersted in this topic in a comparative arena. 

Before starting my doctorate, I obtained a Master of Arts in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at Florida International University, where I focused my studies on Political Science. I also obtained two Bachelor Degrees from FIU in 2013, in Political Science and International Relations. I graduated magna cum laude through the Honors College, was inducted Phi Beta Kappa, and obtained several other scholarly accolades. Extra-curricularly, I was the President of the FIU Debate Team and was a member of one of the top Model UN teams in the US (go Panthers!)
