# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational social scientist who leverages data science tools to conduct high-quality end-to-end public opinion research in the United States and abroad. I am deeply passionate about about developing actionable research insights from rigorous quantitative analysis of survey and social media data. Broadly speaking, I use data science tools to conduct public opinion research, both in my professional role as Director of Data Science at YouGov and in my personal research. I previously worked at Analyst Institute and was a [2017 Google NewsLab Fellow at Pew Research Center's Journalism Project](https://medium.com/google-news-lab/introducing-our-2017-us-news-lab-fellows-d804b7012df2).

I hold a PhD in Political Science from American University. My dissertation studied the effect of online communication on offline political attitudes, with a focus on both textual and visual misinformation. Before starting my doctorate, I obtained a Master of Arts in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at Florida International University, where I studied public opinion about marijuana legalization in Uruguay. I also obtained dual Bachelor Degrees from FIU, where I graduated magna cum laude through the Honors College, was inducted Phi Beta Kappa, and was President of the Debate Team.
