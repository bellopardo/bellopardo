# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a computational social scientist who is passionate about developing actionable research insights from rigorous quantitative data analysis and computational social science. Read more about what I'm up to here!


# Academic 
I am currently pursuing a doctorate in Political Science at American University in Washington, D.C. I study both American and Comparative Politics, and am more specifically interested in public opinion, political communication, and survey methodology. My dissertation studies the effect of online communication on political attitudes, focusing on both textual and visual misinformation. I carry out this research within the American context, but I am also intersted in this topic in a comparative arena. 

Before starting my doctorate, I obtained a Master of Arts in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at Florida International University, where I focused my studies on Political Science. I also obtained two Bachelor Degrees from FIU in 2013, in Political Science and International Relations. I graduated magna cum laude through the Honors College, was inducted Phi Beta Kappa, and obtained several other scholarly accolades. Extra-curricularly, I was the President of the FIU Debate Team and was a member of one of the top Model UN teams in the US (go Panthers!)
