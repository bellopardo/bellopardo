# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a computational social scientist who is passionate about developing actionable research insights from rigorous quantitative analysis. Read more about what I'm up to here!


# Academic & Other Pursuits
I am currently a doctoral candidate in Political Science at American University in Washington, D.C. I study both American and Comparative Politics, but I am more specifically interested in public opinion, political communication, and methodology. My dissertation studies the effect of online misinformation on political attitudes, focusing on both textual and visual misinformation. I carry out this research within the American context, but I am also intersted in this topic in a comparative arena. 

Professionally, I am a Senior Political Analyst at YouGov. I previously worked at Analyst Institute and was a [2017 Google NewsLab Fellow at Pew Research Center's Journalism Project](https://medium.com/google-news-lab/introducing-our-2017-us-news-lab-fellows-d804b7012df2). Before starting my doctorate, I obtained a Master of Arts in Latin American and Caribbean Studies and two Bachelor degreees -- in Political Science and International Relations -- at Florida International University. I graduated magna cum laude through the Honors College, was inducted Phi Beta Kappa, and obtained several other accolades in my undergraduate years.
